# Factor Momentum
Testing whether factor-level mispricings persist due to slow diffusion from residual arbitrageurs

### Overview
This project explores factor momentum: the tendency for factor premia (e.g., value, momentum, quality) to exhibit persistence over time.
The working theory: mispricings at the factor level persist because information diffuses slowly among residual arbitrageurs, leading to predictable return continuation.
This project was developed as part of the BYU Silver Fund, one of the nation’s oldest student-run investment funds.
